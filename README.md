# Git Config
Basic git config with aliases and global ignore. I simply checkout this repo and alias these files to my home directory so git uses them.

## Configuration

Make sure to modify the following lines in `gitconfig`
- Locate the `[user]` definition, and update `name` and `email` (line 24 and 25)
- Locate the `[core]` definition, and update `excludesfile` to point to your `gitignore` (line 31)
